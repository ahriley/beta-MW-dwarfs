# beta-gaia-satellites

This code accompanies the paper "The velocity anisotropy of the Milky Way satellite system" [(arXiv:1810.10645)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10645). We use a likelihood method to compute the radial anisotropy profile of the satellites using new *Gaia* DR2 proper motions and compare the results to those from the APOSTLE and Auriga cosmological simulations.

Please e-mail Alex Riley ([alexriley@tamu.edu](mailto:alexriley@tamu.edu)) with any questions or comments. The repo will likely receive a make-over upon acceptance.
