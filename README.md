This code accompanies the paper "The velocity anisotropy of the Milky Way satellite system" [(arXiv:1810.10645)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10645). We use a likelihood method to compute the radial anisotropy profile of the satellites using new *Gaia* DR2 proper motions and compare the results to those from the APOSTLE and Auriga cosmological simulations.
